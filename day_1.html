<h2>Programming Design</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you&rsquo;ll be able to implement them&hellip; It&rsquo;s a big advantage, when you&rsquo;re considering an idea like putting a college facebook online, if instead of merely thinking &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting idea,&rdquo; you can think instead &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an interesting idea. I&rsquo;ll try building an initial version tonight.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="highlight important">The new reality is that every company is a software company. Even in traditionally brick-and-mortar industries, software is performing more and more of the work. And, of course, many companies (especially &ldquo;lean startups&rdquo;) are purely software-based.</p>

<p class="important">Lacking an understanding of how software works while working in a software world puts you at a disadvantage. In this course, you will build a functional prototype of a software application. To do this, you will learn the Ruby on Rails web application framework, but our higher-level goals are to:</p>

<ul class="highlight">
  <li>Understand the general, platform-independent patterns of how applications work.</li>
  <li>Communicate more effectively and credibly with developers on our teams.</li>
  <li>Develop a builder&rsquo;s eye for problems that can be solved with technology.</li>
  <li>Prioritize features more intelligently by developing a better feel for their costs.</li>
  <li>Be able to make and test small changes to an application yourself.</li>
  <li>Become familiar with the agile development technique.</li>
  <li>Be empowered with a new, powerful, and just plain fun creative outlet.</li>
</ul>
